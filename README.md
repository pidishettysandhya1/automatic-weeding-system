# 🌾 Smart Autonomous Paddy Weeding Robot Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an AI-driven agricultural weeding robot using Python.  
The system models a 2D field environment where a robot autonomously detects and removes weeds while avoiding obstacles.

The simulation includes:

- 🚜 Zig-zag tractor-style traversal  
- 🌾 AI-based weed probability heatmap  
- ⚫ Obstacle detection  
- 📊 Real-time efficiency metrics  
- 🎥 Animated visualization  
- 💾 MP4 export using FFmpeg

## 🚀 Features

- AI-based Weed Probability Mapping  
- Zig-zag Field Coverage Algorithm  
- Obstacle Detection and Avoidance  
- Visual Weed Removal State Transition  
- Live Performance Metrics (Efficiency, Coverage, Timer)  
- Animation Export as MP4

## 🧠 Algorithm Design

### 1️⃣ Weed Prediction Model
A probability heatmap simulates AI-based weed density prediction.

### 2️⃣ Traversal Strategy
The robot follows a zig-zag tractor-style movement pattern to ensure full field coverage efficiently.

### 3️⃣ Obstacle Handling
Cells marked as obstacles are skipped during traversal.

### 4️⃣ Efficiency Calculation

Efficiency = Weeds Removed / Cells Covered
